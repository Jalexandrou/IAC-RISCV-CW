| Branch_o | Adds with 0 so PCSrc == 1? PCNext increments by SignExtend | PCNext increments by 4 |
| ResultSrc_o | Register saves data from ALUResult | Register saves data from Memory->ReadData |
| MemWrite_o | Memory does not write | Memory saves WD in A |
| ALUSrc_o | ALU->SrcB reads from Reg->RD2 | ALU->SrcB reads from SignExtend |
| RegWrite_o | Register does not write | Register saves WD in A |

| Signal | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 |

| ImmSrc_o | Something | Something | Something | Something |
